An improvement team is tasked with studying and improving the pricing process\n",

    "To determine the effectiveness of the reengineering effort, a data set comprised of pre- and post-reengineering periods was compiled. The information contains two measures of behavioral problems. A critical incident occurs when a resident goes AWOL (leaves the premises without permission), destroys property (e.g., punching a hole in a wall or throwing furniture through windows), is caught in possession of street drugs, or engages in assault against other residents or staff members. A teenager is temporarily removed from the facility when s/he is sent to jail or back to a psychiatric hospital"

    "BACKGROUND: Software development projects typically follow six basic phases: Requirements, design, implementation (and integration), testing(validation), deployment (installation) and maintenance. First, general requirements are gathered, and the scope of the functionality is defined. Then, alternative scenarios for the required functionality are developed and evaluated. Implementation, usually 50% or more of the development time, is the phase in which the design is translated into programs and integrated with other parts of the software – this is when software engineers actually develop the code. During the final phases, programs are tested, software is put into use, and faults or performance issues are addressed.\n",

    "ApDudes, a developer of applications for tablet computers, was having difficulty meeting project deadlines; only 10% of their projects had been completed within budget and on time last year and that was starting to hurt business. The group’s project manager was tasked with studying problems within the implementation phase. He found that software engineers were having difficulty prioritizing their work, and that they often became overwhelmed by the magnitude of the projects.\n",
    "    \n",
    "As a result, two changes were made. Each project was broken down into smaller, distinct tasks, or jobs, and each job was assigned a priority. The project manager believes that this classification and prioritization system would speed the completion of high priority jobs, and thus lower overall project completion time"
